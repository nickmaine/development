Choose the following problem, and write a solution in PHP. Go ahead and look up the theoretical concepts required if you need to. Please return your solution within 3 hours. Don't worry if it's unfinished.


1) Write a program that will go to the following 3 sites (www.about.com, www.cnn.com, and www.nytimes.com) and for each site, go to 3 distinct URLs (i.e., don't use the homepage).  For each of the 3 urls visited, parse out each word contained in the body of the page and output a csv file containing two columns, one for the word and one for the word's frequency.  The words counted by your program should only be the words visible to an end-user viewing the page.  
The complete output should be 9 csv files, one for each of the 3 pages visited for each url.
